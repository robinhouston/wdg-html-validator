  This is an XML DTD for writing Frequently Asked Questions FAQs.
  QAML Version 2.4 last modified Oct 6 1999 
        by Justin Higgins (jhiggins@dn.net)
                www.faq.org
        and Rick Jelliffe (ricko@gate.sinica.edu.tw)  
                www.ascc.net/xml/
         
  It is based on the QAML 1.0 DTD, with minimal alterations
  for XML, I18N (internationalization), XLL hypertext linking,
  style, accessability and tracking. Multi-part answers are 
  supported a little better. Corporate and "look-and-feel"
  needs are supported better: rights, PICS, logos, advertising
  sections, corporate addresses.      
    
  * XML: Documents written using the QAML 1.0 DTD
    are structurally compatible with this DTD; however, such
    documents need to be converted into "well-formed" XML:
    make sure they are fully tagged with start-end tags for
    every element. If you are not using 7-bit ACSCII or
    UTF-8, specify the appropriate XML encoding header. If you are
    not using English, specify the appropriate xml:lang language 
    attributes. Use lower-case element type names.
   
  * I18N: All elements with data content, and the top element,
    may have a language attribute. People may have alternative names
    in different scripts: e.g., a Chinese name and an English
    name.  
  
  * XLink: All elements may have an ID attribute. A fixed xml:link
   attribute has been added to link and archive, for housekeeping. 
   (Link is used like HTML's <a> and <img> and <link> element types.
   Archive points to the official location of the current and 
   precious version of the FAQ, and to translations.)
   Note that the xml:show attribute is available in this DTD, but 
   may not be available at the user's system. The following
   link roles are defined by this DTD, but you can add your own:   
        "Text", "Image", "Sound", "Software", "Data", "Interactive"
        are the base Dublin Core categories for the resource types. 
   A logo is a special XLink: it just points to some icon or logo
   or picture. (The logo does not represent a clickable hypertext
   link: it is just for graphical purposes.)  The link elements at
   the start of the head element are intended for similar uses as
   the HTML link element type: a role "bgimage" is defined by this DTD.

   * Style: An element "span" is introduced with the same use as in HTML. 
    All elements have a class attribute, which may help better
    processing in CSS. The following classes are defined by this DTD,
    but you can add your own:
        For section elements: "intro" (a preamble), "rights" (copyright),
        "advert" (for advertising), "info" (for corporate info about the
        siteowner, subject, product, or sponsor) and "links" (related sites);
        For p elements: "li" and "pre", with the HTML meanings: there
                is no provision for nested lists or tables;
        For span elements: "tt", "em", "i", "b" & "strong", with the HTML meanings;
                Also: "definition" and "keyword", for indexing
        For p and span elements: "sent", with the JSML meaning 
                (a sentence); 
        For the span element type: "literal" with the JSML meaning
                (to be spelled out as letters)-this helps WAI too;
        For the span element type: "abbr" and "acronym" are also available,
                (an acronym is pronouncable: NASA), roughly from HTML
        For the div element type: "ul" and "ol" with the HTML meanings. 
                The div element type is new with QAML 2.1; we found we could
                not create good HTML lists without it. However, we have not
                allowed nested lists with it, at this stage.
                
    Note: if you use class="pre", also specify xml:space="preserve" 
    to inhibit the stripping of white space by the XML processor.
    If you are attempting "ASCII art", use
        <p class="pre" xml:space="preserve" alt="explanatory text">...
    where the alt attribute holds some explanatory text.
    
    Please note that you should not rely on format effects 
    (font, boldness) to convey meaning in these FAQs. The output
    system of the user may not support them.
    
    If you do not put your own numbers in titles, you can signify this
    by specifying the autonum attribute on a body or section to "yes". 
    
  * Accessability: QAML has been checked against the W3C WAI guidelines;
    the link, p & span elements can have an "title" attribute.
    The span element can have a class="literal", for contractions to be
    spoken out in individual letters, "abbr" for an abbreviations,
    and "acronym" for acronyms. The latter two may be marked up with
    title attribute for better pronunciation. Multiple logos are possible,
    to allow sound as well as visual logos. 
    Refer /www.w3.org/TR/WD-WAI-PAGEAUTH/
   
  * Dublin Core: The mappings to Dublin Core metadata are noted.
    The Dublin Core type for FAQs is "faq". (The althdr element
    can be used similar to the HTML meta element, to add arbitrary
    kinds of metadata.)
 
  * Tracking: A data attribute has been added to various elements. 
    Use an ISO 8601 format date: yyyy-mm-dd or yyyymmdd.  
    The archive element can link to previous versions and translations.
    The maintainer can advise the preferred subject line to be used
    in emails about the FAQ, using the element type "subject".
    A version element has been added to element type head
    
  * PICS and rights: PICS labels can be added to the header using the
    label element type. Refer http://www.w3.org/PICS/ 
    A text version concerning rights can be given in a section
    with a class="rights" attribute.
    
  * PDA and Wireless Systems: to allow better interaction with PDA and
    wireless systems, which have very small screen real-estate, the 
    <a> answer element type can take a "gist" attribute: this can have
    a 1 to 5 word summary of the answer. The PDA would use that for example:
    Q: What is a dog?
    A: Barking animal >more>
    Q: Are dogs cats?
    A: No! >more>
    where the ">more>" links to the full answer.
